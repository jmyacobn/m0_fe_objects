# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I actually found this content to be quite easy. I spent more time with the notes and practice problems today. I took screenshots of some of my work with the practice to use as a reference which was extremely helpful. Also, I worked in the Zoom Study Hall room so that I could unmute and ask questions as needed. Working in groups in the Zoom Study Hall has been extremely helpful!

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

The note-taking piece is getting better. I have started color coding and highlighting my notes which is helpful. Before Module 1, I would like to get a fresh notebook, number the pages, and keep a table of contents. I do this every year with my students, but did not even think about using this strategy for my own note-taking!

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try on my own, then lean on the notes, then Google, and then reach out to one of my teammates if I am still coming up short!
